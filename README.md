# TCP-UDP Chat Application

## Overview

The TCP-UDP Chat Application is a Java-based chat application that utilizes both TCP and UDP protocols for seamless communication between clients and servers. The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to connect, chat, and exchange messages in real-time.

## Features

- **TCP Communication:** Utilizes TCP protocol for reliable and ordered communication between clients and servers.
- **UDP Communication:** Utilizes UDP protocol for fast and connectionless communication, suitable for real-time messaging.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Implements a client-server architecture for managing multiple clients and facilitating communication.
- **User Authentication:** Provides user authentication mechanisms for ensuring secure access to the chat application.
- **Message Encryption:** Optionally supports message encryption for enhanced security and privacy.
- **GUI Interface:** Offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for intuitive interaction and messaging.

## How to Use

1. **Download and Compile:** Download the source code files and compile them using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac`).

   javac main.java

2. **Run the Server:** Start the chat server by running the `ServerMain.java` file.

   java ServerMain

3. **Run the Client:** Start the chat client by running the `ClientMain.java` file.
